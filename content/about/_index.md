Hi, I am Febrina! I’m an independent artist/illustrator based in Luxembourg!

While taking a break right after finishing my study, I began pursuing art by
creating digital illustrations. Then, on October 2021, I decided to start
posting my art on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/fibinastudio). 
It was apparently one of the best decisions I’ve
ever made, for it pushed me to continue making art, learning more skills, and
getting myself some new, precious friends from among fellow artists.

Recently, I also started doing some commissions for custom portrait
illustrations. You can actually check out the details [here](/commission/)!

Cute, warm, and cozy are three things to describe my work. As I said previously,
as a new artist, I am still improving my skills. I’m dreaming and working hard
right now to have a real, proper art studio and cozy working space for myself
where I can create and design cute illustrations and products in the future.

When I am not drawing, I usually read books (currently into Murakami’s novels)
or learn new languages (日本語を勉強しています).

If you have any questions, please contact me at: me@fibinastudio.com
