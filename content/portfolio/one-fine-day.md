I've had this illustration sitting in my wip folder for ages, and I constantly
find myself going back and forth, trying to make it look right (lol).

So, I decided to just go ahead and post it anyway.

I think that if I never share it, I might forget about it and lose track of
whether I'm making any progress or improving. Creating a full illustration like
this has been one of my goals, so I'm working on it bit by bit. Hehe 🤍
