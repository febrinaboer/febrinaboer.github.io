Finally finished this piece and I really like how it turned out, especially the hedgehog ðŸ¦”. 

<!--more-->

Honestly these little fellas hold a special place in my heart. Theyâ€™re so cute, so round and look so squishy; it feels worth it to hug them despite the spikes ðŸ˜‚

Otherwise lately Iâ€™ve been spending more and more time outside, walking around and enjoying seeing the world changing its colors. I feel so happy that autumn is finally here around me. 

Gonna spend more time also to draw and write in the coming days! ðŸ§¡
