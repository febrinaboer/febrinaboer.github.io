Hi everyone! It’s September and autumn is just around the corner! I am happy to be back with a new blog post, especially after my summer break vacation. Getting back into my writing routine was a bit of a challenge, but here I am, finally finding my rhythm again to finish this blog that has been sitting here for quite some time.

In this blog, I would like to explore my perspective on motivation, drawing from my personal experiences, and how it impacts our productivity and mental state. One concept I want to address is the idea that motivation might be overrated.

## Why can motivation be so overrated?

Whenever I think of motivation, I picture it as some energy that really pumps up my mood and action. It feels so tied to our emotions, almost like the rush of excitement when starting a day or jumping into a new task.

Motivation is often viewed as the driving force or the reason behind someone’s actions or pursuits toward a particular goal. Psychologist Abraham Maslow suggested that our motivations come from a hierarchy of needs. These start with basic survival needs, such as food and safety, and progress to higher needs, like self-actualization and achieving our full potential. As we satisfy one level, we naturally aim for the next.

Many of us would agree that motivated individuals tend to outperform and achieve more. But here’s the catch: we can’t always be motivated all the time, it’s not like a light switch that can be turned on or off at will. There are days when we might feel highly motivated and other days when we feel unmotivated. I recall asking a friend at work about his secret to being so consistently productive. Curious about his source of motivation, his response caught me off guard. He said, ‘I don’t need motivation;  I focus on getting things done.’ It’s a perspective I’ve often heard – that motivation is overrated. 

The label of ‘overrated’ comes from motivation’s deep tie to our emotions, making it challenging to control. Overly relying on motivation, especially when our actions are based on fleeting feelings, isn’t always effective. That’s why I think it’s important not just to rely on that burst of energy but also to find sustainable ways to keep going, even when that first spark begins to fade. 

## On the idea that we don’t have to feel good to start an action

I often tell myself that I lack motivation on days when I don’t feel like doing things. Interestingly, I’ve also noticed that I often feel unmotivated when I have more free time, when I have the time to procrastinate, or when I lack pressure. However, when I’m busy and have a clear set of tasks, motivation becomes less of a concern, and I focus on the action, completing tasks efficiently. It might seem counterintuitive because I personally believe that motivation is essential – we may think it’s hard to start something when we don’t feel like doing it, right? But is that really true? Or is it just an excuse or a sign of something else?

Yes, it’s true that we don’t need to feel motivated to begin a particular task. Often, the feeling of satisfaction arises when we are midway through the task, especially when we see progress in our work, or after we’ve completed it. It’s also worth noting that motivation can stem from discipline, commitment, and a sense of responsibility, even when we’re not in a particularly positive mood.

## Overthinking motivation

When I returned from my vacation in the Netherlands, back in August, I found it challenging to get back into my drawing routine. It felt as though I had left my motivation behind. Instead of taking my time to ease back into my routine, I became consumed with finding that spark of motivation. I would search for inspiring quotes online and spend nights on my couch, scrolling through my phone, hoping to rediscover that drive. Then, the idea that ‘motivation is overrated’ popped into my head, and that thought became the inspiration behind this turtle illustration.

Overthinking motivation often leads to procrastination, which in turn can divert us from reaching our goals. Trying to look for motivation or some kind of inspiration can sometimes give the illusion of productivity when, in fact, we’re merely delaying tasks. I guess the main problem is that we tend to equate the act of wanting to do something or being in a good mood, with high motivation. As a perfectionist myself, I’ve felt the need to be in an ideal mood to begin my day. While mood can influence motivation, they aren’t always directly linked. As previously mentioned, motivation isn’t necessarily something we need before beginning a task, it often develops once we’re started.

Instead of overthinking motivation, it is better to identify the root cause of our lack of motivation. We should remember that we are emotional beings, not machines programmed to function consistently. In the end, I believe that establishing a healthy routine and discipline can enhance our overall productivity and help us stay on track. 

## My strategies for when my motivation is low

Maintaining a positive attitude requires a lot of practice. When I find my motivation waning, here are some strategies that help me stay productive and prevent overthinking:

### Create a weekly schedule and to-do list

Creating small habits and routines while focusing on action is really helpful in maintaining consistency and discipline. When it comes to my daily tasks or projects, I prefer to plan everything in advance. I use a monthly calendar to mark my appointments and highlight important dates. This provides me with an overview of what I’ll be doing throughout the month. For more specific tasks and goals, I usually opt for a weekly schedule where I list all the checklists I need to complete for that particular week. I typically plan my work on Sunday or have the plan ready over the weekend and write it down on Sunday night. Having clear goals and targets truly assists me in staying on track and managing my time efficiently.

### Eliminate distraction by decluttering

This approach works really well for me, especially when I find myself overthinking. Creating a clean environment and eliminating distractions are crucial for enhancing productivity and mental clarity. This reminds me of a quote from Marie Kondo’s book, ‘The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing,’ which states, ‘When I put my house in order, I discovered what I really wanted to do.’ This quote rings true for me as I find it challenging to work in a cluttered space. Clutter easily irritates and stresses me, disrupting my concentration. Whenever I struggle with concentration, I often clean and organize my surroundings. This act not only clears my space but also my mind, improving my focus. It serves as a refreshing break that reduces my stress and prepares me to tackle tasks efficiently.

### Ask myself: Is it a sign of boredom?

In my experience, boredom often contributes to unproductivity. For example,  I enjoy playing games, but when they become too easy and lack challenge, I tend to lose interest and stop playing. This holds true for other activities as well. I believe introducing a bit of challenge can help maintain a positive mindset and improve concentration, ultimately boosting productivity. This concept aligns with the idea of “flow” I encountered in a book I read. The book suggests that tasks that are too simple can lead to boredom, while excessively challenging tasks can result in anxiety. In the end, finding the right balance between challenge and one’s skill level is key to making activities more meaningful.

### Take a physical and mental break when needed: acknowledge that rest is part of productivity  

Rest is a crucial component of productivity. If you often feel guilty about taking a break, particularly if you’re a perfectionist like me, it’s important to recognize that rest is an integral part of being productive. It is important to take both physical and mental breaks when needed. By ‘rest’, I don’t mean procrastination or aimlessly scrolling through social media, as such activities can lead to anxiety. Instead, we need activities that emotionally and mentally refresh us. While a good night’s sleep is invaluable, other forms of recharging our minds and bodies are equally vital for overall productivity. So, listen to our mind and body. Engaging in activities we love, such as following a self-care routine, meditating, taking a walk in the forest, or spending quality time with loved ones where we feel supported and understood, are all valuable ways of recharging our minds.

## Conclusion

Motivation can be considered overrated because it often ties to our emotions, which are hard to control. Many believe that motivation must be present before starting a task. However, motivation often builds once we’ve begun. It’s vital to be mindful and not become overly dependent on motivation, as this is key to maintaining a clear mindset and focusing on our goals. It’s worth noting that motivation can also be cultivated and sustained through other means, such as discipline, commitment, and a sense of responsibility. In addition, overthinking motivation is a primary issue that can lead to procrastination. Identifying the root cause of our lack of motivation and establishing a healthy routine can help us recharge and stay on track with the tasks we need to complete.
