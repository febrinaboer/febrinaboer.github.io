## Insights from my social media break

Hi everyone! Itâ€™s been a while since I last posted here. Honestly, Iâ€™m a bit skeptical about my ability to keep my promise of posting more frequently here (hello, inner critics!), but Iâ€™m making an effort, bit by bit, despite the challenges that life keeps throwing my way. 

You may or may not have noticed my recent absence on Instagram, as I took a break for nearly two months. Thatâ€™s why I havenâ€™t posted anything here, too. However, I must admit that after taking this two-month hiatus from social media, Iâ€™ve been feeling much better. It has allowed me to prioritize the more important aspects of my life and recharge myself from the constant pressures Iâ€™ve been experiencing lately. 

I admit, the feeling of the constant urge to post something new, create reel videos, and promote products and my shop has become overwhelming. Even though I enjoy drawing for its own sake, the pressure of social media, particularly when it comes to running a business, has taken its toll. I sometimes feel like Iâ€™m not working as hard for my shop as I should, and thatâ€™s honestly been weighing on my mind recently.

Specifically about Instagram, earlier this year, I experienced a sudden drop in engagement and reach, especially when I posted content related to my shop, and it was quite discouraging. During my break, my sales also suffered because my reach on Instagram decreased. Since Instagram is my primary platform, itâ€™s crucial for people to discover my work there. 

However, the odd thing is that during my break, I noticed an unexpected increase in new followers. Not many, but it was quite significant compared to a couple of months when I was more active on the platform. Itâ€™s almost as if Instagram wants me to come back, as they keep sending me lots of notifications (lol). After all, they want us to spend more time on the platform, right?

Understanding how the algorithm works is challenging, especially when it feels as if itâ€™s completely random. I know some artists also struggle when they put effort into a post just to receive minimal engagement. This feeling deeply resonates with me, especially as I start my small business. You want people to discover your work, but it feels like the algorithm keeps getting in the way. In this case, I believe taking a step back, resting when feeling tired of it all, seems to be the best approach, or perhaps changing strategies for the business itself. After all, this is my first time having a small business, and of course, there are going to be ups and downs.

## Why slowing down and taking a break is important (especially to prevent burnout)

When it comes to the topic of taking a break, I remember how, in the past, I didnâ€™t view the advice about slowing down or resting as a beneficial idea. While I recognized the importance of taking my time, I also saw it as a potential excuse to avoid fulfilling my responsibilities or a way to justify my own laziness and tendency to procrastinate. 

However, Iâ€™ve come to realize that itâ€™s crucial to allow ourselves to take it easy, particularly for individuals like myself who tend to be too hard on themselves or overthink, which leads to unnecessary complications in life. Although everyoneâ€™s situation may vary, itâ€™s essential to find a balance in every aspect of our lives.

Personally, I still have many art-related goals I want to accomplish. However, there are times when other aspects of my life interfere, and thatâ€™s perfectly fine! Taking breaks is important for finding balance and preventing burnout, as recovery can be more challenging once burnout sets in. Itâ€™s just impossible to be creative all the time, so in my opinion, resting should be also regarded as an essential component of the creative process. Prioritizing self-care, seeking support, and taking regular breaks are the ways I believe are best to manage and prevent burnout.

Despite everything mentioned, I am incredibly grateful for the support I have received for my work and small business. Words cannot express how much art has become an important part of my life. It brings me so much joy to utilize it as a means of self-expression and creative therapy. It feels really rewarding to see how much Iâ€™ve grown and learned on this journey. 

Following my break, I have a newfound sense of positive energy, and I aspire to enjoy the process without being too hard on myself. Additionally, I hope to dedicate more time to growing my shop. That concludes this blog. Thank you for reading until the end, and I genuinely wish that you take care of yourself too ðŸ™‚
