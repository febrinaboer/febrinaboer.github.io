Happy 2023, everyone! I couldn’t be more excited to start writing on this blog. I want to be consistent and make a real effort to stick with this new habit and improve my writing skills. I hope that through this process, I’ll be able to better express my ideas and thoughts through words in a clearer way. Let’s take this journey together!

## My struggles as a perfectionist

So, lately, I’ve been reflecting on my struggles with mental health and my tendency toward perfectionism. I’ve realized that I’ve been unconsciously trying to be perfect my whole life, despite knowing that being perfect is impossible. I push myself to be the best. While I try to find joy in the process and accept what I can’t control, I still feel overwhelmed by my expectations and anxious about what the future holds for me. Do I have an overtly high standard for myself, or am I being too self-critical?

[Perfectionism is a personality trait characterized by striving for flawlessness and setting excessively high standards for performance accompanied by tendencies for overly critical evaluations](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/when-food-is-family/201504/perfectionism-inherited-or-psychological-solution). It can vary in severity and can manifest in different ways. It can be healthy to some degree, as it motivates individuals to set high standards. Still, when excessive or rigid, it can lead to negative consequences such as anxiety, stress, burnout, and procrastination.

I took a personality test online about perfectionism and it turned out that I tend to be a more self-oriented perfectionist. In fact, perfection comes in three forms: (1) Self-oriented perfectionism is when one imposes unrealistic expectations of perfection on oneself; (2) Other-oriented perfectionism is when one imposes unrealistic expectations of perfection on others; and (3) Socially-prescribed perfectionism is when one perceives unrealistic expectations of perfection from others.

With my perfectionist tendencies, I have realized that I am more prone to be anxious and overthinking. My inner critic makes it even worse.

### Inner critics

Despite being a perfectionist and always striving for the best outcomes in everything I do, I always try to value the process more than the results. I have a strong belief that the amount of effort that we put in will give equal results, especially on the things we can control. However, it is difficult for me to not judge myself if something is not working as I expected.

Honestly, I always believe that one should try to improve themselves. We should be better than we were yesterday, but making a tiny mistake or just wanting to relax for a day wouldn’t hurt right? But most of the time it’s not easy for me because my mind won’t stop talking and my inner critics always take over. I feel bad if I am not productive on a specific day, and I regret if I spend my time laying on a couch doing nothing, but often I don’t realize that my body is sending me a signal that I am exhausted and I need rest.

### A draining cycle: overthinking-self-doubt-lack of confidence-overthinking…

I have always been an organized and goal-oriented person. I try to analyze my strengths and weaknesses and strive for improvement. However, I also tend to overthink. I believe that my love of organization comes from my overactive mind, which finds comfort and reassurance in having a clear plan and a sense of control. It’s like telling my brain that we have a plan and everything will be okay.

However, I’ve realized that this can be counterproductive sometimes. Even though I have plans, I still struggle with anxiety, and despite achieving many things in my life, deep down, I still lack confidence and feel like I am not good enough. While I am still working on my problems, I want to share some strategies that are helpful for me.

## My strategies to overcome perfectionist tendencies

### Set the realistic and measurable goal

A goal must be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-related. When setting goals, it is easy to focus on big, ambitious ideas. We may hear phrases like ‘aim for the sky’ and ‘dream big’, but it’s important to also ensure that our goals are realistic. Setting overly high expectations can lead to feeling overwhelmed. Instead of thinking big things: focus on doing the smallest things well. Break the goals down into smaller, manageable steps and work on them little by little.

One example where this has worked well for me was when I was just beginning the process of opening my online art shop. I tried to read some guides and blogs from people online, and from government agencies about the regulations, and everything felt so overwhelming! It felt like there are thousands upon thousands of things that I need to do, and my inner critic immediately exclaimed that there is no way I would ever be able to finish all of those well!

However, by slowing down, and giving myself some time, I managed to bring down the stress a little bit. I re-read the government’s website, for example, about the regulations. Yes, there are a lot of documents that I need to fill out, but it wasn’t like there were thousands of them. I listed them one by one and realized quickly that, oh, this looks manageable. Same with making the website and creating all my products.

Breaking down all the goals into small, simple, and attainable tasks that can be completed in a timely manner, gives a sense of accomplishment and progress. It also helps to foster motivation and the realization that emotional barriers are often the primary obstacles keeping us from reaching our goals

### Practice self-compassion

If you have rude inner critics like me, practicing self-compassion is a number one priority. I have always been modest when it comes to achievement and used to deny compliments. I always felt that if I succeeded, it was only because I had worked as hard as I should have. Even worse, when I overestimated my results, I used to regard my achievements as mistakes and didn’t feel that I deserved them. This kind of mindset only hurt myself.

It is important to celebrate our progress, no matter how small it is, and to appreciate ourselves by saying thank you when someone compliments our efforts and work. When it comes to making mistakes, it’s important to remember that being imperfect is a normal part of being human. Failure and mistakes should be regarded as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than as reflections of our worth as a person.

For me personally, an example where this really helped me a lot was during a period of low sales or when Instagram’s algorithm was not working in my favor. Although it can be discouraging, I tried to remind myself that this is a temporary setback and to stay positive, much like a friend would do to cheer me up.

### Engage in physical activity

Nowadays, we have a lot of time to ruminate and overthink things compared to the past. Our bodies are not designed for a sedentary lifestyle. Particularly if we have a job that requires sitting for extended periods, doing exercises becomes even more important.

Research shows that exercise helps reduce overthinking or rumination, which is a common symptom of anxiety. Personally, whenever I feel anxious or stressed, my thoughts tend to become repetitive and negative, which can lead to a cycle of overthinking and worry. I found that exercising can be a distraction from negative thoughts, redirecting focus to the present moment. It also brings me to “in-motion” state, enabling me to doing my daily activities better. Not only that, it also improves my sleep.

### Trick our mind and stay true to ourselves

Our life is a reflection of our thoughts: We become what we think about, but what our minds tell us is not always true. There are many things in this world that we cannot control. It’s important to accept those things and reframe negative thoughts by looking at a situation from a different perspective. This requires practice, but having the right mindset can be extremely beneficial.

On staying true, I got this challenge often whenever my inner critics came forth, sometimes at the slightest of mistakes, and demanded me to do more. It makes me feel the urge to do things such as posting more and more. I started drawing and making illustrations because it feels cozy and comfortable to do it. Even though I know for some of us small business owners this could be challenging—managing between doing what we like and what we feel like we need to do—for me personally, posting and drawing more frequently rather than doing it slowly and at my own pace, enjoying the comfort of it… it doesn’t feel like me. During those times, when I got those feelings, I mostly tried to stay true to myself, keep calm, and… doodle on!
