I got the idea of sharing some interesting insights from a book that I recently finished reading. As you may know, two of my goals this year are to keep up the habit of reading at least one or two books per month and also to write consistently in my blog. And so I thought, why not do two things at the same time?

Without further ado, let’s get into the blog!

## On Ikigai: The Book, and A Concept Called Flow

Recently, I re-read a book titled “Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life”. This book was written by Hector Garcia and Frances Miralles and I first read it about three years ago. The book explores the Japanese concept of ikigai, which is about finding our purpose in life and the things that bring us joy and meaning. 

According to the book, Ikigai is believed to be discovered at the point where our passions (what we love), skills (what we’re good at), what the world needs, and what we can be paid for intersect. The book also emphasizes the importance of finding balance and connection in life, and how finding our ikigai can lead to improved health and happiness. Moreover, it offers practical tools and insights from the story of Okinawa Island in Japan, which has the highest number of centenarians in the world! Personally, I found that last part up there to be very interesting. It has a lot of reminders for us to find joy in simple pleasures, understand the importance of staying active and having a healthy diet, and value the benefits of having a strong support system.

Overall, it’s a really comforting and inspiring read, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to find their own ikigai.

Another thing that I found to be very interesting, personally, from the book is the concept of something called “Flow”. It’s a very important topic, shown by how it has its own dedicated chapter for it within the book. It’s explained that, in the pursuit of our ikigai, it is also important to find activities that allow us to experience flow, as it can lead to optimal experiences and a sense of purpose and happiness.

When I reflect on an activity that brings me joy, like drawing, for example, there is a certain moment when I become completely absorbed and focused. It’s an extraordinary experience that leaves me feeling fulfilled, especially when I’m able to learn something new or improve my skills. This is precisely when the concept of “Flow” really caught my attention.

But what is flow referring to here, really? Well, flow is a concept that was first introduced by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi as an experience of getting fully involved in an activity to the point where nothing else seems to matter. Basically, when we experience flow, time seems to disappear and we’re completely absorbed in what we’re doing. This is something that definitely feels very oddly familiar and close to me. I’m currently reading Csikszentmihalyi’s book titled “Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience” to learn more about this concept.

And based on what I have learned so far, the idea of flow is to find an activity that is both challenging and enjoyable, allowing for complete focus and absorption, while still offering opportunities for growth and development. To begin, we can reflect on the things that bring us joy and the activities that we find pleasure in doing. Personally, in my case, I could practice by finding flow in drawing and pushing myself to come up with new ideas, while still having fun and improving my skills. It’s also important to find a balance between difficulty and challenge, as a task that is too easy can result in boredom, and one that is too hard may cause anxiety. 

There are some really helpful strategies for increasing our chances of achieving flow, those include: 

+ **Eliminate distractions:** I like to find a quiet and distraction-free environment to work in and minimize interruptions during my work sessions. For me, turning off notifications on my phone and email helps me stay focused.
+ **Choose activities that are challenging but still doable:** This means finding things that push us to grow and develop, but still within our abilities. In my case, I’m currently working on a goal to learn how to draw full illustrations. Although I’ve never felt completely comfortable doing so, I was really proud of myself when I recently completed a full illustration for a DTIYS challenge. My perspective changed when I focused on enjoying the process rather than complicating things due to my perfectionist tendencies, which allowed me to enter a state of flow. The sense of accomplishment from stepping out of my comfort zone was truly rewarding!
+ **Have a clear goal and focus on the process, staying present and not worrying about the outcome or result:** This means focusing on the steps and actions we need to take to achieve our goal, rather than solely on the end result. As we progress, we should keep the objective in mind without becoming overly obsessed with it. This was especially true when I opened my shop. It was natural to feel anxious about whether my products would sell or not.  However, by reminding myself to stay in the moment and not worry too much about the future, I was able to focus on the task at hand. I still find it challenging to avoid overthinking and to stay present, but I am trying to improve little by little every day

## Final Take

By finding activities that bring us joy and a sense of flow, we can continue to grow and develop in our passions. Whether it’s through a new hobby, learning a new skill, or pursuing a long-term goal, finding flow is an important part of living a fulfilling life. 

Finally, to end this blog, I’d like to quote some inspiring words from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: 

> “The best moments in our lives are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times… The best moments usually occur if a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile”
